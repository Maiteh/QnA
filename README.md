IMD Q&A App
===================

This is a Live Q&A app made as a final project for the course Webtechnologie2 2016 of Thomas More.

With the usage of Express.js, Node.js, Socket.io and MongoDB.

At the moment everything is still on the "developement" branch since it's not ready to be published yet.

###  Installing
download the developement branch and install the modules with 
>npm install

Then you can run the app with
> node index.js

The app will be running on *localhost:3000*.

###  What do we have so far
When surfing to localhost:3000 you'll get a login screen where you can choose a login name and password.
Then you'll enter the main room where you can start chatting.
